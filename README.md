# Augmented-EKF
AEKF is developed based on the navigation algorithm codes of Johns Hopkins University UAV lab

This project is corresponding to the imu_ekf2.cpp,imu_ekf2.hpp file in the 
Acopter project(https://github.com/liaoguiqiu/Acopter_project.git)

This matlab project can be used for the navigation algorithms imulation before implementation on microprocess
